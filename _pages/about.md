I am currently pursuing my PhD in computer science under the guidance of Prof. Alex Bronstein and Prof. Reuven Cohen. My research is primarily centered around the application of deep learning techniques to temporal data, specifically focusing on two main areas: the physiological responses to exercise and communication networks.

In my work, I explore how deep learning can be utilized to understand and predict complex temporal patterns in these fields. For the physiological aspect, I aim to estimate VO2 using wearables such as Garmin watches and predict injuries using wearable data. In communication networks, my focus is on optimizing and predicting network behavior under varying conditions for 5G networks, QUIC protocols, and teleoperated driving. This dual focus allows for a broad application of temporal deep learning methods and provides insights into both human and technological systems.

My deepest academic passion involves merging my primary hobby, running, with my research. I strive to estimate and predict physiological parameters, which are traditionally expensive to measure, using affordable equipment such as sport watches. Developing a complex system to predict VO2 using only watches instead of a costly metabolic system, and predicting injuries from long-term training trends, is my primary passion.

I am married to Shir Cohen, who holds a PhD in computer science as well. I am a proud father to Romy, and we have a German shepherd named Zeus. Additionally, if I am not with my family, I can usually be found running or reading books about running. I am a marathon runner with a personal best of 2:43 in the Valencia marathon.
