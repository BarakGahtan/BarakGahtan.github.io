I am currently pursuing my PhD in computer science under the supervision of Prof. Alex Bronstein and Prof. Reuven Cohen. My research focuses on applying deep learning techniques to temporal data, with two primary areas of interest: understanding physiological responses to exercise and optimizing communication networks.

In the field of physiology, I develop deep learning methods to estimate VO2 and predict injuries using wearable data, enabling cost-effective monitoring without the need for lab-based equipment. This is achieved by aligning different latent spaces. I also analyze training activities with smartwatches, even without explicit activity sessions, to gain insights into performance and recovery. In communication networks, my work spans QUIC traffic analysis and teleoperations, where I optimize network performance using real-world data. This includes developing machine learning models to predict cellular network behavior for teleoperated driving and analyzing encrypted QUIC traffic to understand server-client interactions.

My passion lies in using real datasets to solve practical problems. I merge my love of running with data science by using wearable data to model physiological trends, while in communications, I emphasize real traffic and network data to enhance teleoperations and encrypted traffic analysis.

I am married to Shir Cohen, who holds a PhD in computer science as well. I am a proud father to Romy, and we have a German shepherd named Zeus. Additionally, if I am not with my family, I can usually be found running or reading books about running. I am a marathon runner, ASICS Front Runner member, with a personal best of 2:43 in the Valencia marathon.
