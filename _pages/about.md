I am currently pursuing my PhD in computer science under the supervision of Prof. Alex Bronstein and Prof. Reuven Cohen. My research focuses on applying deep learning techniques to temporal data, with two primary areas of interest: understanding physiological responses to exercise and optimizing communication networks.

In the field of physiology, I develop deep learning methods to estimate VO2 and predict injuries using wearable data, enabling cost-effective monitoring without the need for lab-based equipment. This involves aligning different latent spaces to enhance insights from diverse datasets. My work also extends to analyzing training activities from smartwatches, even in the absence of explicit activity sessions, to gain valuable insights into performance and recovery. Additionally, I work with medical data to address challenges such as predicting COPD readmission probabilities and exploring the interplay between diabetes, GCM (glucose monitoring), and accelerometer data. I investigate how XYZ accelerometer readings correlate with physiological trends and human activity recognition, even without explicitly recorded sessions on wearables.

In communication networks, my research spans QUIC traffic analysis and teleoperations, focusing on optimizing network performance using real-world data. This includes developing machine learning models to predict cellular network behavior for teleoperated driving and analyzing encrypted QUIC traffic to understand server-client interactions.

My passion lies in using real-world datasets to solve practical problems. I merge my love of running with data science by modeling physiological trends using wearable data, while in communications, I emphasize leveraging real network traffic to enhance teleoperations and encrypted traffic analysis. Whether working with physiological, medical, or network data, my goal is to drive innovation through actionable insights and practical applications.

Outside of work, I am married to Dr. Shir Cohen, who also holds a PhD in computer science. I am a proud father to Romy, and we share our home with Zeus, our loyal and energetic German Shepherd. When Iâ€™m not spending time with my family, I can usually be found running, coaching amateur athletes in long-distance running, or reading books about the sport. As a passionate marathon runner, I am a proud member of the ASICS Front Runner team and hold a personal best of 2:43 from the Valencia Marathon.
