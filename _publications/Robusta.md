This paper presents Robusta, a hybrid recoverable cache leveraging PMem and DRAM to get the best of the two: DRAM-like low latency for very frequent items, reduced tail latency due to Pmemâ€™s large capacity, and warm start on fail- ure recovery. Robusta is implemented as a wrapper around Caffeine, a state-of-the-art Java cache that is integrated into a range of production systems, including HBase, Druid, Solr, and Cassandra.
