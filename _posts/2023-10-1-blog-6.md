The Science Behind Running - Lactate
------
***"Lactate threshold" is a critical yet often misunderstood term in the field of endurance training. This blog seeks to clarify its role, its importance for athletes—especially runners—and the methods that can be employed to optimize this vital physiological indicator for improved running performance.***

Lactate, a byproduct of carbohydrate metabolism in our muscles, is often misunderstood as a waste product. In reality, it's an alternative fuel source that our bodies utilize during intense workouts. When exercising at a moderate pace, our bodies primarily burn fat, producing minimal lactate. However, as exercise intensity escalates, our bodies lean more on carbohydrate metabolism, leading to increased lactate production.

Here's an example for context: When a runner is placed on a treadmill and asked to progressively increase speed, their lactate levels remain steady at first. But, at a certain point, the speed gets to a level where the lactate production increases significantly; this is what we call the lactate threshold.

The lactate threshold is a key physiological measure in the world of running, indicating a runner's capacity to sustain a particular pace without accumulating an excessive amount of lactate in their bloodstream. When the rate of lactate production exceeds the body's ability to clear it, an onset of rapid fatigue follows, making the runner slow down. This threshold is often calculated as a fraction of one's maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) or identified as a specific pace. Broadly, a higher lactate threshold means that a runner can keep up a quicker pace for a longer time before exhaustion sets in.

Increasing this lactate threshold is crucial for long-distance runners, as it empowers them to endure higher intensity levels without reaching the brink of exhaustion. Runners can work towards improving their lactate threshold through specialized training routines like tempo runs, where they maintain a pace slightly below the lactate threshold for a fixed duration. This type of workout helps the body adapt and become efficient at lactate clearance, even during high-intensity exercise. As a result, the lactate threshold gradually improves, allowing runners to keep faster paces during competitions without the risk of early fatigue. By incorporating such targeted training into their schedules, runners can enhance their performance, cultivating the necessary endurance and resilience for success in their chosen distance events.
